This mod adds cannons to the game.

Massive cannons capable of wreaking havoc to any types of opposing force. Firepower of such magnitude puts fear into the hearts of all who stand before it.


Stats:

HP = 10
size = 1
min range = 20
max range = 200

(for comparison, Trebuchet max range is 160)

Cost: 3000g
UpKeep: 30g

requires: Artillery



How to Obtain:
The cannons appear in the SiegeEquipment inventory.


You will need to obtain both GunPowder and Iron in order to enable the Artillery Upgrade.

However this means Pagans will not have direct access to cannons since Gunpowder requires the AlchemistLab upgrade from either a University or Madrasah.




Note: I wasn't able to figure out how to add new models into the game, so I'm reusing a smaller version of the Battle Ram model.



Future Plans:
Add a new PaganBelief for access to gunpowder
